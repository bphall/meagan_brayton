stats project, meagan and brayton, anova/chi-square on case study csv

We decided to use 'Mental Health Days', seasons, gender, and the proportion of bad mental health days per month to look at relationships in the case_study.csv.

We found that there was no dependence between seasons and mental health days in the data, either from the continuous or proportion data via an ANOVA and Chi-Square test. We did, however, find that there was a significant difference between males and females with respect to their bad mental health days per month.
